			Quality, Service, and Pride; These characteristics shaped Chris's illustrious career in woodworking. His upbringing in rural western North Carolina greatly influenced his work ethic and initiated his development as a self starter and his profound appreciation for hard work. He began in woodworking at an early age, progressively learning all of the ins and outs of color making. Decades later, Chris's experience in custom cabinets and cabinet finishing is unparalleled. Now his passion eventually manifests itself in the form of Conversion Finishes, which is headed by his youngest son, Nick Stevens. While Chris has ceded the lead role to Nick, the guiding principles attributed to Chris's success and experience have been passed down and continue to define Conversion Finishes and its dedication to quality and professionalism. <img class="homepage2" src="../images/IMG_20191129_181643_edit.jpg" alt="d2" style="height: 300px;width: 225px;margin: 10px">
			</p>
			
			<p class="intro-text-wrapper3"> To some it may come as a surprise that Chris also has an adventurous side. While Chris is not advising Nick or working in his industry position at Sherwin-Williams, he spends much of his time with his wife Angie, traveling many weekends throughout the year. He and Angie utilize these opportunities to embark on road trips to places ranging from the North Carolina coast to the California coast to visit his son Chase and his daughter-in-law Kathryn. Chris takes great pride in his family, supporting them with relentlessness working to ensure Angie and all 3 of his sons are cared for. Chris's continued motivation largely stems from his love for family and desire to serve others, truly epitomizing what it means to be selfless. </p>
			
			<p class="intro-text-wrapper6"> Chris's adept skill set and experience have made Conversion Finishes into the growing company it is today. Chris's perseverance built the company from the ground up, drawing on his extensive knowledge that has been developed over a lifetime. Nick continues to honor Chris's contributions to the company through implementation of his ideas and background in accounting and business education. Conversion Finishes is now one of the leading makers of custom cabinets in western North Carolina, which is accentuated by a unique combination of quality while delivering products at a competitive price. Chris's legacy lives on through the company, which stands to experience continued growth through the continued refinement of an already successful model. </p>
